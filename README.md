# RAM-Sniper
When running out of memory, a Windows system seizes up killing every process. This prevents that from happening by designating a process to be killed before RAM is full, at a user set threshold (default 95%). When this happens a sound is played and the target process is killed, so the user is warned that RAM is getting full.
